# APOD Viewer

The app utilizes the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API provided by NASA to deliver users a unique space image every day.
With APOD Viewer, you can enjoy beautiful and inspiring photographs of celestial objects on a daily basis. The main image of the day is displayed on the app's home screen, accompanied by a brief description explaining what is depicted in the photo.

However, APOD Viewer doesn't limit itself to the current day. The app offers users the ability to browse and select images from past dates. This feature is perfect for those who want to explore and learn more about previous space photographs and discoveries.
